# College Event Management System - Apache Configuration Solution

## Problem
- Apache cannot start on port 80 because it's blocked by system process PID 4 (HTTP.sys)
- XAMPP Control Panel continuously shows errors when trying to start Apache
- This prevents the College Event Management System from running properly

## Solution Implemented
1. Apache has been configured to run on port 8080 instead of port 80
2. SSL has been configured to run on port 4433 instead of port 443
3. All backend configurations updated to work with port 8080
4. Frontend configured to connect to backend on port 8080

## Current Status
✅ Apache is running on port 8080 (processes 22504 and 22980)
✅ All API endpoints are accessible and working
✅ CORS is properly configured for cross-origin requests
✅ Registration and login functionality is working
✅ Database is connected and operational
✅ React development server is running on port 3000

## How to Maintain the Solution
1. Use the batch file "start_apache_port8080.bat" to start Apache when needed
2. Avoid using XAMPP Control Panel to start Apache (it will try to use port 80)
3. The system will continue to work correctly on port 8080
4. All application functionality is preserved

## Access Points
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8080/college_fresh/
- API: http://localhost:8080/college_fresh/backend/

## Services Running
- Apache: Port 8080 (main) and 4433 (SSL)
- MySQL: Port 3306
- React Dev Server: Port 3000

The College Event Management System is fully operational and stable!
